# Midtrans Webhooks

## Introduction

This documentation is not mandatory and does not need to be known for my api users, but it is necessary to know if you want to deploy your own api with the source code I made this to handle the integration of your api with the midtrans platform

All you need to know is the endpoint to be set up to your Midtrans account "/orders/weebhoks/midtrans"

## Weebhooks midtrans

```
