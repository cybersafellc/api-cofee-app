# Cofee App [REST API]

## Introduction

This is the API/backend part of my Cofee App project. I make the API public, anyone can use it/consume the API, especially for those who are learning frontend web developers or mobile applications you can use it for free.

This API application has 2 roles, namely ADMIN and USER, you can implement 2 separate applications or combine them into one, it's up to you

Here's the documentation
